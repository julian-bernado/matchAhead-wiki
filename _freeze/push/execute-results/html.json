But with the sparseness of my fully-focused sustained attention on a full-time basis, it's been a bit hard keeping it all in my head. I wanted to get everything down in a format that could serve like a textbook for finishing writing all the code and then writing the paper. I want to do it in this format rather than plain notes so that I can have a browsable, densely linked set of notes that may include typeset math or code.\n\n## Main pages\n* [where we're at](whereweat)\n* [Notation](notation)\n* [matchAhead procedure](matchAhead)\n* [Pimentel procedure](pimentel)\n\n\n\n",
