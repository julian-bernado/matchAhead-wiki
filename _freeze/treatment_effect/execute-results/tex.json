Matched students to students within those schools\n\nAs such, let's imagine a dataset indexed by school $i$ and student $j$ with four variables:\n* $T_{ij}$: treatment indicator for student $j$, uniform within an $i$, in $\\{0,1\\}$.\n* $Y_{ij}$: actual outcome for student $j$, within $\\mathbb{R}$\n* $\\hat{Y}_{ij}$: estimated outcome for student $j$, within $\\mathbb{R}$\n$ $S_{ij}$: school, within $[S]$\n\nThen, we want to estimate treatment by the following specification as in propertee:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# output <- lmitt(Y ~ 1,  data = df, specification = Treatment ~ block(student_match) + uoa(std_id), absorb = TRUE)\n# spec <- obs_spec(Treatment ~ cluster(Group) + block(school_match), data = df)\n# output@StudySpecification <- spec\n# print(summary(output))\n```\n:::\n\n\nas debugged by Ben and Julian on September 22nd.",
